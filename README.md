## Translation syntaxes

### I18n (YAML)

The default [Rails Internationalization API](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html).

```ruby
# Regular
t('inbox.title')

# Pluralization
t('inbox.message', count: n)

# Interpolation
t('inbox.hello', name: @user.name)
```

With the source YAML file:

```yaml
en:
  inbox:
    title:   'Title to be translated'
    message:
      zero:  'no messages'
      one:   'one message'
      other: '%{count} messages'
    hello:   'Hello %{name}'
```

You can keep your source YAML file automatically updated using [i18n-tasks](https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks).

### GetText

This gem adds the GetText support to Rails. We [strongly suggest](https://translation.io/blog/gettext-is-better-than-rails-i18n)
that you use GetText to translate your application since it allows an easier and more complete syntax.

Moreover, you won't need to create and manage any YAML file since your code will be
automatically scanned for any string to translate.

```ruby
# Regular
_("Text to be translated")

# Pluralization
n_("Singular text", "Plural text", number)

# Regular with context
p_("context", "Text to be translated")

# Pluralization with context
np_("context", "Singular text", "Plural text", number)

# Interpolations
_('%{city1} is bigger than %{city2}') % { city1: "NYC", city2: "BXL" }
```

More information about GetText syntax [here](https://github.com/ruby-gettext/gettext#usage).

## Installation

 1. Add the gem to your project's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'translation'
```

 2. Create a new translation project [from the UI](https://translation.io).
 3. Copy the initializer into your Rails app (`config/initializers/translation.rb`)

The initializer looks like this:

```ruby
TranslationIO.configure do |config|
  config.api_key        = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345'
  config.source_locale  = 'en'
  config.target_locales = ['fr', 'nl', 'de', 'es']
end
```

 4. Initialize your project and push existing translations to Translation.io with:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake translation:init
```

If you need to add or remove languages in the future, please read our
[documentation](https://translation.io/blog/adding-target-languages) about that.

## Usage

### Sync

To send new translatable keys/strings and get new translations from Translation.io, simply run:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake translation:sync
```

### Sync and Show Purgeable

If you need to find out what are the unused keys/strings from Translation.io, using the current branch as reference:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake translation:sync_and_show_purgeable
```

As the name says, this operation will also perform a sync at the same time.

### Sync and Purge

If you need to remove unused keys/strings from Translation.io, using the current branch as reference:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake translation:sync_and_purge
```

As the name says, this operation will also perform a sync at the same time.

Warning: all keys that are not present in the current local branch
will be **permanently deleted from Translation.io**.

## Manage Languages

### Add or Remove Language

You can add or remove a language by updating `config.target_locales = []` in your
`config/initializers/translation.rb` file, and executing `rake translation:sync`.

If you want to add a new language with existing translations (ex. if you already have
a translated YAML file in your project), you will need to create a new project on
Translation.io and run `rake translation:init` for them to appear.

### Edit Language

To edit existing languages while keeping their translations (e.g. changing from `en` to `en-US`).

 1. Create a new project on Translation.io with the correct languages.
 2. Adapt `config/initializers/translation.rb` (new API key and languages)
 3. Adapt language names and root keys of the YAML files in your project (optional: adapt GetText directories and `.po` headers)
 4. Execute `rake translation:init` and check that everything went fine.
 5. Invite your collaborators in the new project.
 6. Remove the old project.

Since you created a new project, the translation history and tags will unfortunately be lost.

### Custom Languages

Custom languages are convenient if you want to customize translations for a specific customer
or another instance of your application.

A custom language is always be derived from an [existing language](https://translation.io/docs/languages).
Its structure should be like:

```ruby
"#{existing_language_code}-#{custom_text}"
```

where `custom_text` can only contain alphabetic characters and `-`.

Examples: `en-microsoft` or `fr-BE-custom`.

### Fallbacks

If a translation is missing for a regional (`fr-BE`) or custom (`fr-microsoft`)
language, then it will fallback to the main language (`fr`).

Locale fallbacks will work as expected with both [I18n (YAML)](#i18n-yaml) 
and [GetText](#gettext) syntaxes.

A good way to leverage this feature is to ignore sentences from a regional language
that would have the same translation as the main language (usually most of them).
It's way easier to maintain the project over time if only 10% of the regional sentences
need to be adapted.

Note that fallbacks are chained, so `fr-BE-custom` will fallback to `fr-BE` that will
fallback to `fr`.

Just make sure to add `config.i18n.fallbacks = true` to your `config/application.rb` file.
You can find more information about this
[here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-i18n).

## Change the current locale

### Globally

The easiest way to change the current locale is with `set_locale`.

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :set_locale

  [...]
end
```

First time the user will connect, it will automatically set the locale extracted
from the user's browser `HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE` value, and keep it in the session between
requests.

Update the current locale by redirecting the user to https://yourdomain.com?locale=fr
or even https://yourdomain.com/fr if you scoped your routes like this:

```ruby
scope "/:locale", :constraints => { locale: /[a-z]{2}/ } do
  resources :pages
end
```

The `set_locale` code is [here](https://github.com/translation/rails/blob/master/lib/translation_io/controller.rb#L3),
feel free to override it with your own locale management.

Don't forget to define your available locales with
[I18n.available_locales](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#setup-the-rails-application-for-internationalization).

More examples here: https://translation.io/blog/set-current-locale-in-your-rails-app

### Locally

This command will change the locale for both [I18n (YAML)](#i18n-yaml) and [GetText](#gettext):

```ruby
I18n.locale = 'fr'
```

You can call it several times in the same page if you want to switch between languages.

More examples here: https://translation.io/blog/rails-i18n-with-locale

## Frontend Localization

### Using this Gem

This gem is also able to cover frontend localization (React, Vue, ...).

There are several ways to pass the translation strings from the backend
to the frontend: JavaScript serialization, `data-` HTML attributes, JSON files etc.

The easiest strategy when dealing with React/Vue would be to pass the corresponding
translations as props when mounting the components.

Assuming that you use [reactjs/react-rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails),
it would look like this if you want to use [I18n (YAML)](#i18n-yaml) syntax:

```erb
<%= 
react_component('MyComponent", {
  :user_id => current_user.id,
  :i18n    => YAML.load_file("config/locales/#{I18n.locale}.yml")[I18n.locale.to_s]["my_component"]
}) 
%>
```

Your `en.yml` should look like this:

```yaml
en:
  my_component:
    your_name: Your name
    title: Title
```

You can also directly use the [GetText](#gettext) syntax:

```erb
<%= 
react_component('MyComponent", {
  :user_id => current_user.id,
  :i18n => {
    :your_name => _('Your name'),
    :title     => _('Title')
  }
}) 
%>
```

In both case, in your React component, you can simply call
`this.props.i18n.yourName` and your text will be localized with the current locale.

**Notes:**

 * You can also structure the i18n props with multiple levels of depth and pass the subtree as props to each of your sub-components.
 * It also works great with server-side rendering of your components (`:prerender => true`).

### Using our official React & JavaScript package

As Translation.io is directly integrated in the great
[Lingui](https://lingui.js.org/) internationalization framework,
you can also consider frontend localization as a completely different
localization project.

Please read more about this on:

 * Website: [https://translation.io/lingui](https://translation.io/lingui)
 * GitHub page: [https://github.com/translation/lingui](https://github.com/translation/lingui)

## Continuous Integration

If you want fresh translations in your Continuous Integration workflow, you may
find yourself calling `bundle exec rake translation:sync` very frequently.

Since this task can't be concurrently executed
(we have a [mutex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion) strategy with
a queue but it returns an error under heavy load), we implemented this
threadsafe readonly task:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake translation:sync_readonly
```

This task will prevent your CI to fail and still provide new translations. But
be aware that it won't send new keys from your code to Translation.io so you
still need to call `bundle exec rake translation:sync` at some point during
development.

## Advanced Configuration Options

The `TranslationIO.configure` block in `config/initializers/translation.rb` can take several optional configuration options.

Some options are described below but for an exhaustive list, please refer to [config.rb](https://github.com/translation/rails/blob/master/lib/translation_io/config.rb).

### Disable GetText or YAML

If you want to only use YAML files and totally ignore GetText syntax, use:

```ruby
TranslationIO.configure do |config|
  ...
  config.disable_gettext = true
  ...
end
```

In contrast, if you only want to synchronize GetText files and leave the YAML
files unchanged, use:

```ruby
TranslationIO.configure do |config|
  ...
  config.disable_yaml = true
  ...
end
```

### Ignored YAML keys

Sometimes you would like to ignore some YAML keys coming from gems or so.
You can use the `ignored_key_prefixes` for that.

For example:

```ruby
TranslationIO.configure do |config|
  ...
  config.ignored_key_prefixes = [
    'number.human',
    'admin',
    'errors.messages',
    'activerecord.errors.messages',
    'will_paginate',
    'helpers.page_entries_info',
    'views.pagination',
    'enumerize.visibility'
  ]
  ...
end
```

### Custom localization key prefixes

Rails YAML files contain not only translation strings but also localization values (integers, arrays, booleans)
in the same place and that's bad. For example: date formats, number separators, default
currency or measure units, etc.

A translator is supposed to translate, not localize. That's not his role to choose how you want your dates or
numbers to be displayed, right? Moreover, this special keys often contain special constructions (e.g.,
with percent signs or spaces) that he might break.

We think localization is part of the configuration of the app and it should not reach the translator UI at all.
That's why these localization keys are detected and separated on a dedicated YAML file with Translation.io.

We automatically treat [known localization keys](lib/translation_io/yaml_entry.rb), but if you would like
to add some more, use the `localization_key_prefixes` option.

For example:

```ruby
TranslationIO.configure do |config|
  ...
  config.localization_key_prefixes = ['my_gem.date.formats']
  ...
end
```

### Source file formats (for GetText)

If you are using GetText and you want to manage other file formats than:

 * `rb`, `ruby` and `rabl` for Ruby.
 * `erb` and `inky` for Ruby templating.
 * `haml` and `mjmlhaml` for [HAML](http://haml.info/).
 * `slim` and `mjmlslim` for [SLIM](http://slim-lang.com/).

Just add them in your configuration file like this:

```ruby
TranslationIO.configure do |config|
  ...
  config.source_formats      << 'rb2'
  config.erb_source_formats  << 'erb2'
  config.haml_source_formats << 'haml2'
  config.slim_source_formats << 'slim2'
  ...
end
```

### Gems with GetText strings

Public gems usually don't make use of GetText strings, but if you created and localized your own gems
with the GetText syntax, you'll want to be able to synchronize them:

```ruby
TranslationIO.configure do |config|
  ...
  config.parsed_gems = ['your_gem_name']
  ...
end
```

### Paths where locales are stored (not recommended)

You can specify where your GetText and YAML files are on disk:

```ruby
TranslationIO.configure do |config|
  ...
  config.locales_path      = 'some/path' # defaults to config/locales/gettext
  config.yaml_locales_path = 'some/path' # defaults to config/locales
  ...
end
```

### GetText Object Class Monkey-Patching

GetText methods (`_('')`, etc.) are available everywhere in your application.
This is made by extending the global `Object` class.

You can disable the built-in `Object` monkey-patching if you
prefer a more granular approach:

```ruby
TranslationIO.configure do |config|
  ...
  config.gettext_object_delegate = false
  ...
end
```

Don't forget to manually include the GetText methods where needed:

```ruby
class Contact < ApplicationRecord
  extend TranslationIO::Proxy
end
```

## Pure Ruby (without Rails)

This gem was created specifically for Rails, but you can also use it in a pure Ruby project by making some arrangements:

```ruby
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'active_support/all'
  require 'yaml'

  class FakeConfig
    def after_initialize
    end
    def development?
      false
    end
  end

  module Rails
    class Railtie
      def self.rake_tasks
        yield
      end

      def self.initializer(*args)
      end

      def self.config
        ::FakeConfig.new
      end
    end

    def self.env
      ::FakeConfig.new
    end
  end

  task :environment do
  end

  require 'translation'

  I18n.load_path += Dir[File.join('i18n', '**', '*.{yml,yaml}')]

  # Put your configuration here:
  TranslationIO.configure do |config|
    config.yaml_locales_path = 'i18n'
    config.api_key           = ''
    config.source_locale     = 'en'
    config.target_locales    = ['nl', 'de']
    config.metadata_path     = 'i18n/.translation_io'
  end
```
